## Running the application
There are two projects in this repo, webapp (React.JS) and api (node)

### **Using terminal from the project root: **
### 1. Get the api up and running

```
cd api 
npm i
npm run start
```

This should run the backend, leave the terminal running.

### 2. Get the webapp up and running
Open another terminal from the project root and execute: 

```
cd webapp
npm i
npm run start
```

Voila! your app should be app and running now, open the browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the Single Page App.
